	<h1> Introduction </h1>
	
		Finding the true origins of all life has been a mystery for the human race since the beginning. 
		Many theories have been formed to try and solve this mystery and many debates have been made to either disprove a theory or push one forward. 
		Throughout the years, different methods and technologies, such as radiocarbon dating and Thermoluminescence, have been developed to attempt 
		to solve this mystery. Recently, the use of molecular records, particularly molecular clocks, have come to light with biologists and paleontologists
		alike.

		Many think this method will solve this mystery once and for all, others believe it will not. The problem however, is that the molecular clock 
		is a flawed method that should not at all be used to date organisms. Only wrong answers will come out of using molecular records and all research that
		goes towards solving the big mystery will become completely skewed with wrong research and evidence.
