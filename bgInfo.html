		Molecules and proteins can evolve as an organism can. Some proteins and molecules however are highly conserved and do not change. 
		Scientists study the slight changes in the conserved molecules (referred to as molecular clocks) to draw conclusions on past evolutionary 
		events. Scientists use special methods to find a constant rate of change that occurs in a molecular record, this is configuring the molecular 
		clock.

		Several decades ago, it was proposed that if DNA mutates at a constant rate, then you can measure the differences between 
		the DNA from two present day animals. This created problems as when calculations were made for vertebrates to calibrate a scale 
		it gave  incorrect dates when compared to other organisms because different organisms have different rates of evolution. Each organism 
		has their own rate of change that must be found separately.
