	<h1> Main issues with molecular records </h1>
	
	Contrary to popular belief, mutations that occur in organisms are not consistent and can either become 
	slowed down or sped up. This could be due to electromagnetic radiation, catastrophe evolution or the sex 
	and age of the reproducer. Though the rate of mutation changes only slightly, trying to measure molecular clocks 
	is like trying to tell time with a clock that ticks at different speeds.

	Because of this, molecular clock dating results produce conflicting dates with the fossils being studied. Peter Wilf, 
	a paleontologist and professor of geoscience talks about how molecular clocks produce results that are just wrong. He says the following:
	<br><br>
	"Paleontology and molecular clocks have a long, uneasy relationship [...] Paleontologists want molecular clocks to work. 
	However, for years we have seen molecular dates, mostly for very deep evolutionary events, that are much older than the corresponding 
	fossils [...] Here, we looked at many new plant fossils from the extremely productive region of Patagonia, and we found the opposite, 
	that the fossils are much older than the clock dates. In this case, we can definitely say that the clocks are wrong. The fossils prove it." 
	-Peter Wilf

	Wilf talks about how plant fossils in the region of Patagonia provide contradicting results with the fossils and the molecular data, 
	this is a frequent problem scientists have with molecular records and as such, a conclusion can be made that using molecular records 
	does not work, the assumption that the frequency of mutation occurs constantly is the major flaw behind the erroneous results provided 
	by molecular records.
	<br><br>
	Dating of molecular records is a difficult task, inappropriate use of clocks can lead to incorrect calibrations which provide inaccurate 
	answers. Mistakes made while using this method must have happened at some point, this could be due to trying to research obscure taxa or by 
	making estimations from molecular clock assumptions. Some molecular records that are currently stored might be incorrect altogether.
