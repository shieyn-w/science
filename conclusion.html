	<h1> Conclusion </h1>	
	The molecular clock is an intricate method with lots of flaws, too many to be considered truly useful. 
	The sole belief that genetic mutations happen at a constant rate ensures that only wrong results can be
	found with molecular clocks, dating from fossils only worsens the molecular clockâ€™s reliability providing 
	completely different results and performing molecular clock calibrations is incredibly challenging that some 
	current records might not be correct. Everyday, we continue to unravel the mystery of when we started and how, 
	we have created technology to help us solve this mystery, molecular records are certainly not a step in the right 
	direction if we ever want to correctly solve this mystery.
